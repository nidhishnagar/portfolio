# My Proud Moment üöÄ

## Transforming Road Safety with Innovation

Years later, I co-founded **Tvashtr Biotech**, but as I worked on the startup, I realized my true calling lay elsewhere‚Äî**improving road safety**. I left Tvashtr Biotech to dedicate myself fully to this mission. Through rigorous research and development, I created a technology to track truck speed and driving behavior accurately.

### Key Milestones
- **Implementation Success:**  
  Presenting this solution to the UltraTech Cement Maihar plant was a pivotal moment. After gaining access to test and implement the technology, we saw a significant improvement in driver safety.
  
- **Indo-German Startup Camp:**  
  At just 20 years old, I was selected for the prestigious Indo-German Startup Camp, where I had the privilege of learning about entrepreneurship in Germany. *(That's me in the black t-shirt!)*

- **Sustainability Crunch Summit (SUS Crunch):**  
  Another highlight was presenting my solution at SUS Crunch, where I spoke to changemakers while wearing my cream-colored coat. I passionately shared my vision of safer roads and the broader impact of reducing overspeeding‚Äînot just saving lives but also cutting down pollution.

### Recognition and Validation
One unforgettable moment was when representatives from **Thea Ventures** expressed admiration for my work and its potential. Their validation reinforced my belief in creating positive change and inspired me to push forward with my mission.

### My Vision üåç
I will continue striving to ensure no one else loses their loved ones due to reckless driving. Together, we can make our roads safer for everyone.
